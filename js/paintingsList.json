Mona is an Italian honorific given before the name of a married woman, and Liza is the name of the woman who was the model for the portrait. In other words, it means Mrs. Liza in Korean. In Italian and French, it is called La Gioconda, which means Giocondo's wife, or the merry woman, or the laughing woman. This painting is a pioneering work in many ways. It uses an oil painting technique, which was new at the time, and uses a sfumato technique to soften the lines to give a misty effect. The composition takes the form of a pyramid, which was the most basic portrait composition at the time. In addition, the method of arranging the figure higher than the background is a method commonly used by painters today, but it was rare in the Renaissance.",

This is the first of two paintings by Adele painted by Klimt.This painting is also called Lady in Gold. As such, gold was abundantly used as a material. It is also the work that used the most gold among Klimt's portraits. The model in the portrait is Adele, the wife of wealthy Austrian businessman Ferdinand Bloch. Bloch wanted to show off his wealth, social status, and artistic taste through portraits of his wife. Klimt, who penetrated Bloch's heart, decorated Adele with a golden decoration technique he had invented to satisfy the customer's needs. The golden decoration technique refers to a luxuriously decorated expression technique combining gold and various patterns.There are two main effects of the golden decoration technique. First, gold is a symbol of wealth, power, beauty, and immortality, and is an object of worship and homage by humans. Medieval painters used pure gold powder instead of paint to evoke awe when they painted Christ and the Virgin Mary. Klimt used precious and luxurious gold abundantly to elevate Adele, a real woman, to an object of worship in an unreal world.",

It is one of the last works by the Dutch master, believed to have been completed within two years of his death in 1669. Depicting the moment the prodigal son returns to his father in the biblical parable, this work is a famous work described by art historians. The theme of the work is the story of Chapter 15 of Luke's Gospel in the New Testament. Rembrandt chose a scene where human love, forgiveness, and tolerance are well revealed in the plot of this story. The father gently closes his eyes and caresses his son's shoulder with a friendly hand, as if trying to suppress the pain and sadness of the past caused by his son. The figure of the son kneeling in front of his father is dwarf and shabby. The older brother, who is standing wearing expensive clothes and a fancy hat, is looking at his father and his lost brother with a stern expression. The father's benevolent face, white beard, and bloodless hands, highlighted by bright light, remind us of God's love for humans. The son, dressed in rags and with sloppy hair that looks like it has been ripped off, is a sinful human figure. The people depicted darkly behind symbolize envy, heartlessness, and sin. Rembrandt, a great religious painter in history, tried to interpret the meaning of the Bible with a deep understanding of the evil heart inside man and the pain that follows.",

He painted the night scenery looking out of the hospital room by combining memory and imagination, which embodies Van Gogh's inner and subjective expression of nature.

In this painting, Van Gogh's unique strong brushstrokes are well revealed and the contrast of colors is achieved by using various primary colors. In particular, this work shows a lot of blue color as a whole, and this blue seems to show Gogh's expression and his depression in the painting. It seems that Van Gogh expressed his anguished inner self through self-portraits. And overall, very bright colors were used a lot. The face, which is an important part of the self-portrait, is a combination of white, pink, and yellow, and green is used intermittently to make it look very splendid. The eyes give a strong impression by contrasting the complementary colors of green and red. In 1978, an incident occurred in which a viewer cut the piece into an X shape with a knife. Fortunately, it has been well restored, so if you look at it from now on, you will not know that it is a damaged work, but if you look up from the bottom, you can see the X mark. Through this work, it can be seen that a strong color tone was explored. Exaggerated colors and brush strokes may make the portrait look like an Indian, but this attempt is intended to see how far the colors can be utilized",

Degas shared a passion for modern subjects with the Impressionists. Degas' paintings depicting the dramatic world of ballet and theater have a certain feel-good stimuli. However, Degas, who was fascinated by the human form, was also an outstanding draftsman who admired the paintings of the old masters and Ingres. His interest in the human figure is evident in the painting above. Another painting of the same scene, Dance Class, depicts dancers waiting to be evaluated by ballet teacher Jules Perrault. Degas patiently prepared this painting by drawing countless numbers of dancers posing in his studio. His lively brushwork, light, and bright colors were typical of the Impressionists. The use of color is partly influenced by Japanese prints, and the dramatic 'cut-off' composition - in which the subject is cut out of the frame of the picture - is also taken from Japanese prints, applied not only to this painting but to all others.

Such a greenhouse may have been more than a greenhouse. French painter Alix-Louise Enault's Consolation depicts the Paris Conservatory as a luxuriously decorated and intimate venue, a secluded interior conducive to personal encounters. At first glance, we see a double portrait of a stylish and attractive couple of any social status. They are Manet's friends and the Giyume couple who ran a clothing store. Their marital status is conveyed by rings, and the proximity of hands is the closest hint of intimacy. The woman becomes the focal point of the portrait, but is more prominently placed and dressed in flashy clothing. The physical separation, the lack of connection with the audience, and the abstract gaze create a sense of separation, a major theme of contemporary criticism of the work. The interaction of the lines formally defines the action. The woman has an upright posture that reverberates against the vertical slats of the bench, while the man leans forward but doesn't break that vertical.

As the title of the painting suggests, the women are showing the act of gleaning from the left in a continuous movement. It is like looking for ears, picking ears, and straightening your waist halfway to put the bunch of ears you just picked up into the pocket made by tying your apron.

Celebrating the July Revolution of 1830 that brought Louis-Philippe to power, the painting became a symbol of the spirit of the French Revolution. The painting caused a sensation at the Salon of 1831, and Louis-Philippe bought it to commemorate his accession to the throne. In fact, however, he considered the painting highly provocative and removed it from public view. This painting monumentally combines contemporary events and allegories. Notre Dame Cathedral in the distance and people wearing different clothes according to their class (the scruffy boy on the right symbolizes a commoner) clearly indicate the place and era of the painting. The figure of freedom holding high the tricolor flag dominating the scene aroused people's anger. It is because it shows a messy woman with half-naked clothes stepping over a corpse with strong brush strokes, rather than realizing idealized beauty. This painting showed Delacroix's transition to a softer approach that appeared in his later work.

            "text":"In 1910 Picasso and Fernande Olivier spent a summer vacation in Cadaques, and this was where Woman with Mandolin originated. Having emerged from an Early Cubist phase which seemed, in part, expressive, Picasso was now in the throes of Analytical Cubism, a period during which he invested surface ornament with intrinsic value. In this picture, the characteristic fragmentation of form is carried to almost unrecognizable lengths. Only the mandolin is comparatively easy to identify in the lower reaches of the composition.' Both the outlines of the figure and its internal drawing have been broken down into interpenetrative geometrical elements. The coloration is dominated by brown tones paling to beige. Blue-grey accents, often directly juxtaposed with dark, structural lines, imbue the painting with facet-like plasticity. Despite the considerable problems of interpretation which this picture presents and would present in even greater measure were it not for the title, Girl with Mandolin is by no means totally devoid of realism. Picasso was concerned, not with the mimetic reproduction of a woman holding a musical instrument, but with the objective nature of his subject - hence, for all the painting's tendencies toward formal dissolution, its unmistakable retention of plasticity.

            "text":"Joaquin Sorolla was a Spanish painter whose style was a variant of Impressionism. His best works, painted outdoors, vividly depict Valencia's sunny coast. He is known for his skillful rendering of people and landscapes in the bright sunshine of his country and under the sunlit waters. This picture was no different. Painted on the beach in Valencia in the summer of 1909. Water and sandy beaches, depicted in long brush strokes in blue, purple, and turquoise, become an abstract backdrop. The shot appears to be taken from a photo frame common in Sorolla's work. The horizontal lines are removed and Clothilde's hat is cut off. What we see here is a perfect example of the iconographic genre of the graceful promenade with well-dressed bourgeois figures walking along the beach. Sorolla, like the French Impressionists, mixed this white with many other colors. So, shades of blue, yellow, lilac or orange are light and shadow effects in the form of white. In bright white, the figures stand out clearly from the rest of the image. Light characterizes the early evening of a Mediterranean summer day. The already setting sun emerges from the direction of the viewer on either side of the women, who cast long shadows looming on the beach behind them. This play of lighting effects under the southern sun is typical of Luminismo Valenciano. Spanish Impressionism is a special form of Neo-Impressionism, the main representative of which was Joaquín Sorolla. ",

            "text":"The Jewish Bride is a painting by Rembrandt, painted around 1665-1669. The painting gained its current name in the early 19th century, when an Amsterdam art collector identified the subject as that of a Jewish father bestowing a necklace upon his daughter on her wedding day. This interpretation is no longer accepted, and the identity of the couple is uncertain. The ambiguity is heightened by the lack of anecdotal context, leaving only the central universal theme, that of a couple joined in love. Speculative suggestions as to the couple's identity have ranged from Rembrandt's son Titus and his bride, or Amsterdam poet Miguel de Barrios and his wife. Also considered are several couples from the Old Testament, including Abraham and Sarah, Boaz and Ruth, or Isaac and Rebekah, which is supported by a drawing by the artist several years prior. While technical evidence suggests that Rembrandt initially envisioned a larger and more elaborate composition, the placement of his signature at lower left indicates that its current dimensions are not significantly different from those at the time of its completion. According to Rembrandt biographer Christopher White, the completed composition is one of the greatest expressions of the tender fusion of spiritual and physical love in the history of painting.",

A catalog from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam describes it as 'a couple as an Old Testament figure, known as a Jewish priest'. This explanation implies that there is disagreement as to whether the painting should be viewed as a mere portrait of two people, a depiction of a biblical figure, a religious painting, or both. However, the reason why this painting cannot be seen as a mere portrait is because of the pious and solemn atmosphere that this painting exudes, as well as the ambiguity of time and place. This has led to the view that the painting is based on a biblical story.There is also a view that the man and woman in this picture are Isaac and Rebekah from Genesis 26. There is one drawing in New York that has been interpreted to be of Isaac and Rebekah. It can be seen that there is a clear relationship between the drawing and this painting in terms of the background and the position of the figure (however, the figure of King Abimelech, which can be seen in the upper right of the drawing, is not visible in this painting). X-ray examination revealed that the two standing figures were initially seated, as in the drawing. On the other hand, this man and woman are also seen as Jacob and Rachel in Genesis 29.  ",

This work depicting a scene from Shakespeare's play Hamlet, in which a young and beautiful woman is dying as if lying on a river with flowers in her hands, is considered one of the masterpieces that best reveal the spirit of the Pre-Raphaelites. Pre-Raphaelite painters got a lot of inspiration from Shakespeare's literature, especially Ophelia's tragic and romantic story. Millay portrayed Ophelia, the heroine of tragic love, in a neat and beautiful, dramatic and sensual way. For this work, Millay stayed for four months by the river Hogsmill near Surrey, England, and painted the background of the painting. Dozens of different plants and flowers are carefully described here, each with symbolic meaning. The willow tree appears in the part depicting the river in Shakespeare's original work, but it is also because of the symbol of 'abandoned love'. The nettles growing in the meantime mean suffering, daisies imply innocence, pansies imply futile love, and violets imply loyalty. The red poppy, which symbolizes death, is particularly emphasized.

Its composition is based on an inverted triangle and is reminiscent of well-balanced, harmonious lines and a heart (both in color and shape). The main figure is the Virgin Mary, humble and pious, with an emotional expression, downturned eyes, straight nose and crooked lips. The meaning that the inverted triangle represents the heart is reinforced and Mary points to her heart, evoking reverence in the viewer. To the viewer's right is God the Father, represented as a majestic old man, and to the left is the long-haired figure of Jesus Christ. Together they hold Mary's crown above her head. In the center, the Holy Spirit is represented in the form of a white dove. The heads and doves of the two figures are both level with the triangle's base line, representing equality within the trinity. Also noteworthy are the cherubs around the Virgin at the bottom of the painting. It rivals the quality of paintings by Murillo, famous for his cherubic-themed works. The colors Velázquez uses are blue and purple. He also used carmine (particularly Venetian carmine) instead of the traditional red, following the advice of his teacher Pacheco, as documented in his book Arte de la Pintura.",

In this painting, the portrait of the Spanish royal family from the 16th century is closely followed in the composition of objects and backgrounds that indicate the character's posture or status, while Velázquez's unique style and innovative attempts are well fused. Princess Margarita in the picture is wearing a blue silk dress edged with a voluminous silver belt, following a design that was very popular in Spain from the 1640s.The head and chest are also decorated with colorful ornaments of the same blue color as the clothes. In her left hand, she holds a large muff cylindrical sleeve for a haired woman, which she may have intentionally included in the picture as it was a gift from the Habsburgs. These luxurious clothes and accessories were effectively reproduced through the colorful colors and unique vivid textures common to Velázquez's later works. This was possible because he used loose brushstrokes like those of impressionist painters rather than meticulously drawing. The work drawn in this way looks like a combination of color dots from a close distance, but shows a perfect shape from a distance. The characteristics of this unfinished technique are well revealed in the right hand and the surface of the clothes. On the other hand, the relatively detailed face of the princess is charming and has dignity and formality appropriate to her status, but at the same time reveals childlike innocence, liveliness, liveliness, and subtle capture of emotions.

In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The singlets of both men in the foreground and the table cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.

This masterpiece depicts the events of that time. In 1816, the categorical battleship Medusa set off with about 400 men and officers on its way to the colonies, but it ran aground. Abandoning the boat, the crew boarded a lifeboat, but a large raft was built for the remaining 149 people. But out in the ocean, the rope broke, and a bloody battle broke out on the raft for water and food. When the rescue boat appeared, there were 15 survivors, all of them dying. The report stirred Serron, and Jericho does a good job of describing the excited moment when the rescue boat showed up.

Ice skating in rivers and creeks across the Seine. It is one of the few winter landscapes that Renoir completed, aside from a few minor studies, because he hated cold weather. At the time of painting, the park itself was relatively new, and construction began in 1852 under a public works program led by Georges-Eugène Haussmann at the direction of Napoleon III. The Bois de Boulogne was completed in 1858 as Haussmann renovated Paris. The scene is thought to have been painted near Lac pour le Patinage, an artificial lake. Renoir chose the park because he preferred the painting crowd. The painting is in the style of Pochard and has the quality of an unfinished sketch, but the brushwork is bold and the composition is fully realized. The scene uses an elevated perspective to represent the western portion of the park. The subject matter is reminiscent of old Dutch ice skating landscapes popularized by painters such as Hendrick Avercamp (1585–1634). Several dogs can be seen in the work, which reflects Renoir's thematic interest in the life of the Parisian bourgeoisie.

It presents a dramatic confrontation between two people immersed in playing cards like a scene in a play in which time has stopped. A long wine bottle is placed vertically in the middle of the table, and the screen is divided into two evenly with this as the axis. The two men on the screen look very serious and determined as if they are facing the most important moment of choice and execution in their lives. Cézanne gave a sense of unity to the screen with ocher and brown tones, and depicted the tense confrontation between the two characters through a solid composition and symmetrical composition. The hands of the two people gathered in the center of the screen and the cards they hold, the arms symmetrical to each other, the curves of the back, and the two hats reveal a perfect sense of balance, as if looking in a mirror. The figure on the left side of the screen is painted a bit darker, but the pipe in his mouth, the collar of his shirt, and the distinct whiteness of the two cards in his hand give a glimpse of his side that carefully considered even the contrast.",

            "text":"One of the many characteristics of Van Gogh's paintings is that colors do not depend on form or composition, but directly convey the individual's emotions or the beauty of the subject. He used colors according to his subjectivity to express his emotions strongly rather than to reproduce exactly what was in front of his eyes. Even in this work, the night scenery is expressed without using black at all, and the cafe's canopy is painted in yellow, close to lemon color. Also, the golden light from the gas lamps on the terrace dyes people and the surroundings yellow like a protective wall, and the façade of the cafe along the brick floor reflects the blue light from the gas lamps. The strong color contrast between dark blue and bright yellow gives us a glimpse of his philosophy, which placed the most importance on subjective emotions felt in the physical world.Furthermore, when describing the houses on the street, the fact that they are not bound by the laws of perspective, that the form is exaggerated rather than the actual one, and the way of expressing the characters as if they were drawn hastily with thick paint are also noticeable. From this, it can be assumed that Van Gogh sought new rules of painting that could most appropriately reveal the things he loved and his passionate inner world through independent use of colors and individual forms. This shows that he was aware that painting could be a means of expressing individual thoughts or psychological states more freely, escaping from the pressure of depicting illusory spaces, which was considered important by earlier painters.

Trembling, this figure with both hands on his face is located at the bottom of the screen and is facing the audience. From his skeletal face, a terrified scream and a tearing scream flowed out. The composition of the background screen is boldly treated with oblique lines, and the dynamic processing of the face line and the color matching to the three primary colors of red, yellow, and blue show a more intense effect in terms of formality.

This acceptance of the arts allowed Arcimboldo to thrive at his court. This was especially true for the unprecedented and unique style for which Arcimboldo became known. My initial impression of Arcimboldo's Vertumnus is that it is a joke due to the quirky nature of the piece. Vertumnus, however, is not only presented as a joke. Rather, the use of fruits and vegetables demonstrates the transformation of world power for the reign of Rudolf II. It was to give. The imperial patrons behind Vertumnus, certain fruit selections that serve as power propaganda, and copies of Vertumnus distributed throughout Europe all suggest its role as a political allegory. The portrait of Rudolf II itself encapsulated the perfect balance and harmony with nature, art and science, which Rudolf II believed he represented during his reign. These portraits express the Renaissance spirit's fascination with the mystery, the enigma, and the eccentric. The search for unique and captivating works of art was a common trend among the Renaissance elite, giving Arcimboldo the perfect opportunity to captivate viewers with his unique style.

The canvas measures 65 cm x 80 cm and is signed P.Cézanne in the lower left corner. This painting is famous for its detached perspective. It has been described as a balanced composition due to its disproportionate parts. The tilted bottle, the tilted basket, and the reduced lines of the cookies mesh with the lines of the tablecloth. The table depicted in the picture creates a shape that cannot be tilted without a right angle. The basket of apples also tilts forward and appears to be held in place by the bottle and a folded tablecloth. In this painting, Cézanne did not intend to depict the subject in a realistic manner. He used heavy brushwork to create greater density than would be seen in real life. He once described art as a harmony parallel to nature.This purpose of achieving harmony in composition and structure is evident in this painting. In creating this composition, Cézanne challenged the idea of Linear perspective. Since the early Renaissance, artists have used a single vantage point to create the illusion of space. Cézanne recognized that the human perspective is far more complex than seeing an object from a fixed point of view. Instead, he expressed a moving perspective by looking at things from different perspectives. To this end, he carefully deconstructs images by presenting various perspectives. This is evident from the way the cookies are depicted on the table. Cookies appear to be viewed from the side, but also slightly from above. ",

The yellow lights shine as if burning themselves, struggling not to be buried in the deep and thick blue waves. The size of the two men and women drawn in front is relatively small, showing a sense of contrast. The challenge of painting at night intrigued Van Gogh. The vantage point he chose for Starry Night allowed him to capture the reflections of Arles' gas lights across the shimmering blue waters of the Rhône.

It is marked with the date and signature of 1434 and van Eyck, and is the oldest and most famous of the paintings using oil paint instead of tempera, along with the Ghent Altarpiece painted with his brother Hubert. In 1842, the National Gallery in London purchased this painting and exhibited it. This painting shows a typical style prevalent in Flanders in the 15th century, with surprisingly realistic and precise expression of detail, brilliant colors, and expression of spatial depth by experience rather than mathematical perspective. In particular, the realistic detail expression maximized through oil paint, which is said to have been invented by Jan van Eyck, stands out. ",

            "text":"Delacroix's work, Greece Standing on the Ruins of Missolonghi, completed in 1826, shows the dynamism and dramatic scenes characteristic of the Romantic style, and the expression of exotic landscapes. The place where this work is set is Missolonghi, a city in western Greece. In 1825, Missolonghi was occupied by the Turkish army, which was ruling Greece at the time, and the Greek War of Independence against the Turks took place here. Such an event was a subject that attracted the attention of French intellectuals at the time, and Delacroix also chose a real incident that occurred at the same time as the subject of his work. Through this work, he wanted to support Greece's independence and express the ideology of democracy and freedom. At the center of the work is a woman dressed in typical Greek attire, with her breasts exposed, standing in the whirlpool of a terrible war. Delacroix borrows traditional Christian iconography from the woman's posture and dress. The blue coat and white skirt mean innocence, and the woman's arm movements are typical prayer gestures. She is kneeling on her left knee on a pile of rocks, her arms half-raised expressing her longing for freedom. The Greeks who were at war at the time would rather kill themselves after destroying their cities than surrender to the Turkish army. In the lower right corner of the work, the remains of a collapsed building and the arms of a corpse are revealed, vividly showing the terrible situation at the time. On the other hand, on the back of the woman, there is an enemy soldier planting a flag on the ground.",

            "text":"His works do not properly draw what he is looking at by coldly observing, criticizing, and arranging it, but directly depicting it with burning passion. It burns his mind and body as he continues to look at it and feels it, and it whips up that impulse to create his touch and rhythm, making him vibrate. For that reason, he only expresses originality. Looking from the happy Arles period, the works painted in Saint-Remy after entering a mental hospital expose more intensity. The wind is harsh in that region, so even in this scene, barley sways in the fields of Saint-Remy, and the trees are holding the wind. Repeated touches on the barley in the foreground transmit waves of passion and drift around, the lowly developed mountains move, and white clouds swirl in the sky. And on the right side stood an arborvitae tree. The olive tree, with its branches rolled up, is like a green flame. Moreover, the melancholy that can be felt even in the barley field is full of flow, and the few flowers in front of it are dotted with a pitiful red light. Unlike Arles, the landscape of Saint-Rémy is desolate, and this work also expresses it in color, and the powerfully moving expression gives Van Gogh an impression of being unshakable and desolate in a jumping impulse. Van Gogh only continues to create works that burn the mind and body, but as it is said that life is the most important thing in painting, it is rare to see an artist who has brought that life to life as much as Van Gogh.",

            "text":"This is a 1642 painting by Rembrandt. It is on display at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Contrary to the title, the background is daytime. After painting, varnish is applied at the last step to protect the painting. This varnish reacts with heat and oxygen over time, turning yellow and black. Rembrandt's paintings were also blackened by self-oxidation of the varnish applied to protect the painting and give uniformity to the screen. So the day seemed like night. In the process of restoring Rembrandt's painting in 1940, conservators removed the severely discolored varnish and found Rembrandt's hidden light in the process of repainting it. It is regarded as Rembrandt's representative and immortal masterpiece. Night view has three important elements. The first is the huge size, the second is the appropriate use of light and shadow, and the last is that the portraits of soldiers at the time are drawn. The Night View was completed in 1642, at the height of the Dutch Golden Age. The work has the same name as the work, and has the captain Frans Vanning Koch in black and red girdle and the lieutenant Willem van Ruytenburg in yellow and white girdle. Rembrandt's appropriate use of light and shadow directs his gaze to three important places - the crowd in the background, the captain Frans Banning Koch and Lieutenant Willem van Ruetenburg in the center, and the girl to the left of the center. Behind them is Ensign Jan Visscher Cornelissen holding the emblem of the militia.",
